> Core invariants: residue \(R\) from zeta‑regularized log‑det of Δ, and τ from the Berry–Quillen connection.  
> Mapping‑cone model (Def. 2.5) makes Δ⁰=D*D explicit; Δ⁰,Δ¹ share nonzero spectrum (Lemma 2.6).  
> Verification inequality (Thm 2.4) reduces equivalence to finite bounds from entropy curvature \(K\).
